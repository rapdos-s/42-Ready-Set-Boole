To calculate gray code in a simple way, follow:
Find MSB (Most Significant Bit) of the number. Use MSB as first bit of gray code.
Then, for each bit from MSB to LSB (Least Significant Bit), XOR the current bit with the previous bit.

To calculate gray code in a more efficient way, follow:
G(n) = n ^ (n >> 0b1)
