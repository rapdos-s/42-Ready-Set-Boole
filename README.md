To calculate gray code in a simple way, follow:
Find MSB (Most Significant Bit) of the number. Use MSB as first bit of gray code.
Then, for each bit from MSB to LSB (Least Significant Bit), XOR the current bit with the previous bit.

To calculate gray code in a more efficient way, follow:
G(n) = n ^ (n >> 0b1)

- If the formula is empty, throw an exception.
- If the formula has only one character:
  - Return true if it's '1', false if it's '0'.
  - Otherwise, throw an exception.
- Iterate over each character in the formula:
  - If it's '0' or '1', push its boolean value onto the stack.
  - If it's '!', pop one value, apply NOT, and push the result.
  - If it's a binary operator ('&', '|', '^', '>', '='):
    - Pop two values, apply the operator, and push the result.
    - If there are fewer than two values, throw an exception.
- After processing, the stack must contain exactly one value.
  - If not, throw an exception.
  - Otherwise, return the final result.
